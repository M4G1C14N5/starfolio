# Football Scouting Report

An end-to-end football analytics platform built on a professional GCP data stack. Covers 7 seasons (2017–2024) of player statistics across Europe's Big 5 leagues, with a player similarity model and an interactive Streamlit scouting app backed by BigQuery.

---

## What it does

- **Scrapes and cleans** player statistics from FBref across 5 stat categories (standard, shooting, passing, defending, goalkeeping)
- **Loads data** into Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery via an automated ETL pipeline
- **Computes similarity** between players using position-aware cosine similarity on z-scored per-90 stats
- **Visualises** player percentile rankings and similar players through a Streamlit app that queries BigQuery live

## Data

| Source | FBref.com |
|--------|-----------|
| Seasons | 2017-18 through 2023-24 |
| Leagues | Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 |
| Tables | Standard, Shooting, Passing, Defending, Goalkeeping |
| Records | ~14,000 player-season observations |

---

## Key engineering decisions

**Transfer aggregation** — Mid-season transfers create duplicate player-season rows in FBref (one per club). The cleaning pipeline detects these and aggregates them: counting stats are summed, per-90 rates are recalculated from aggregated totals, and identity columns are taken from the spell with the most minutes. This runs automatically for all five stat categories with table-specific rules.

**Name normalisation** — Different FBref stat tables use slightly different name spellings (transliterations, middle names, name changes). A fuzzy-matching pass within each (Season, Squad) group at similarity ≥ 0.60 resolves these. Constraining to the same squad makes false positives extremely unlikely.

**GK data** — Goalkeeper stats are sourced from raw HTML (not CSV) because FBref's HTML export contains duplicate column names that require multi-level flattening. The pipeline handles this automatically.

**Join key** — Tables are joined on `(Player, Season)` rather than `(Player, Season, Squad)` because loan players can appear under different club names across stat categories. Nine remaining orphan rows are a known limitation of this approach.

**Parameterised queries** — All BigQuery queries use `@parameter` syntax rather than f-string interpolation, guarding against query breakage on player names containing apostrophes (e.g. O'Brien).

---

## Similarity model

Defined in `src/similarity.py`. Uses cosine similarity on z-scored per-90 stats.

1. Players are grouped into four pools by primary position: ATT, MID, DEF, GK
2. Each pool has a curated feature template (15 stats for outfield, 5 for GK) focused on per-90 and rate metrics — raw counting stats are excluded to avoid penalising players with fewer minutes
3. Feature columns are z-scored across the pool so no single stat dominates by scale
4. Cosine similarity is computed between the query player and every other player in the same pool
5. Results are returned ranked by similarity score, filtered to players with ≥ 450 minutes

**Known limitation:** With FBref data, goals and assists naturally carry high signal weight. More granular tracking data (pressing, spatial, ball retention) would improve result quality.

---

## App

`app.py` — Streamlit, runs locally against BigQuery.

- Filter by season(s), league, and team before searching
- Text search filters the player dropdown as you type
- Three tabs per player: **Stats** (raw or per-90 toggle), **Percentile Ranks** (position-specific bars), **Similar Players** (similarity model output)

---

## Setup

**Requirements**

```bash
.venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**GCP authentication**

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

**Configure project**

Edit the two config lines at the top of `gcp_loader.py` and `src/similarity.py`:

```python
GCP_PROJECT = "your-project-id"
GCS_BUCKET  = "your-bucket-name"
```

**Run the cleaning pipeline**

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python run_cleaning.py
```

**Load data into GCP**

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python gcp_loader.py
```

**Start the app**

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python -m streamlit run app.py
```
